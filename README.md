# README.md

Implementing randomized linear algebra methods for model order reduction.

## Requirements :
This work is based on some packages listed below. For some reasons, conda can take forever to solve environment when installing packages from conda-forge. A solution is to use pip instead (when possible).

- pymor (`pip install pymor[all]`);
- matplotlib (`conda install matplotlib`);
- numba (`conda install numba`)
- scikit-sparse (`conda install -c conda-forge scikit-sparse`);
- spams (`pip install spams`);
- sklearn (`pip install sklearn`);
- scikits-umfpack (`pip install scikit-umfpack`).
